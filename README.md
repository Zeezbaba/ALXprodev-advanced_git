# Git Flow

## 📘 Overview

**Git Flow** is a branching model for Git, proposed by *Vincent Driessen*, that helps developers manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a consistent and scalable way.

It introduces well-defined roles for branches and helps teams coordinate code changes more effectively. Git Flow is especially useful for large-scale projects where multiple developers work on various features simultaneously.

### 🚀 Git Flow Branch Types

Git Flow revolves around five primary branch types:

- **`main` (or `master`)** – Production-ready code
- **`develop`** – Ongoing development
- **`feature/*`** – New features in progress
- **`release/*`** – Preparation for production releases
- **`hotfix/*`** – Critical bug fixes on the main branch

## 🧠 Relevance in the Development Process

Git Flow improves:

- ✅ **Code organization** by clearly separating development stages
- 🤝 **Team collaboration** through structured branching and merging workflows
- 🧪 **Code stability** by allowing features to be tested before production
- 🚀 **Release management** by isolating release-specific tasks

Git Flow is widely adopted in agile and CI/CD environments, ensuring seamless integration and deployment pipelines while reducing conflicts and regression bugs.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this, learners should be able to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of Git Flow
- Identify the different branch types and their roles
- Apply Git Flow in real-world collaborative development projects
- Manage feature development, hotfixes, and release cycles using Git best practices

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

- Explain how Git Flow helps manage large codebases and team contributions
- Create and manage branches following the Git Flow model
- Use Git commands to initiate features, releases, and hotfix branches
- Integrate Git Flow into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments

## 🛠️ Git Flow Best Practices

| Best Practice                 | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Start with `develop`         | Always branch off from `develop` for new features, not `main`.              |
| Feature Isolation            | Keep each feature in its own branch to reduce merge conflicts.              |
| Merge via Pull Requests      | Use pull/merge requests for all merges to ensure code review.               |
| Keep `main` clean            | Only production-ready code goes into `main`. Never push untested code here. |
| Tag Releases                 | Use Git tags on `main` to mark official release points.                     |
| Use `hotfix/*` for urgent bugs | Apply emergency fixes directly to `main` via a hotfix and merge back to `develop`. |
| Document your workflow       | Maintain clear documentation of your Git Flow in the project’s README or wiki.|

## 🧾 Common Git Flow Commands

```bash
git flow init                     # Initialize Git Flow
git flow feature start <name>    # Start a new feature branch
git flow feature finish <name>   # Finish feature and merge into develop
git flow release start <x.x.x>   # Start a release branch
git flow release finish <x.x.x>  # Merge release into main and develop
git flow hotfix start <x.x.x>    # Start a hotfix branch
git flow hotfix finish <x.x.x>   # Finish hotfix and merge into main & develop
